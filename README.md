# Much naiveté about naiveté

This repository seeks to explore the label of naïve in academic discourse.

"Naïve" is sometimes distilled as a single throwaway word to define a smorgasboard of "idealisms," when in fact idealisms are more of a seasoned practice for many "naïve." The wording of naïve is often used in a conclusive sense, in that the context of the language appears to use naïve in coded language. While it may appear to be the simple opposite of "sophisticated," it could also mean lack of subordination to a sophisticated organization. Thus for something to be truly naïve, it has to lack awareness of any type of system. Thus, the level of adherence to a cause becomes the dominant qualifier of naivety, rather than true innocence:

"Culture
The naïf appears as a cultural type in two main forms. On the one hand, there is 'the satirical naïf, such as Candide'.[2] Northrop Frye suggested we might call it "the ingénu form, after Voltaire's dialogue of that name. "Here an outsider ... grants none of the premises which make the absurdities of society look logical to those accustomed to them",[3] and serves essentially as a prism to carry the satirical message. Baudrillard indeed, drawing on his Situationist roots, sought to position himself as ingénu in everyday life: "I play the role of the Danube peasant: someone who knows nothing but suspects something is wrong ... I like being in the position of the primitive ... playing naïve".[4]

On the other hand, there is the artistic "naïf - all responsiveness and seeming availability".[5] Here 'the naïf offers himself as being in process of formation, in search of values and models...always about to adopt some traditional "mature" temperament'[6] - in a perpetual adolescent moratorium. Such instances of "the naïf as a cultural image... offered themselves as essentially responsive to others and open to every invitation... established their identity in indeterminacy".[6]"

"Feigning naivety", or "playing naive," while it can be a used as a tool, is not equivalent to naivety as a lifestyle or ideology. Obviously being naive for the sake of being naive can be questioned, but applying naivety towards genuine inquiry in Situationist contexts is a potent concept.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability also plays a role. Falsifiability is the science of seeking exceptions to a rule- in science, this is most famously seen by Special Relativity. As the world follows Newtonian Motion, it is all but an practical approximation of time travel.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism "Pyrrhonism is an Ancient Greek school of philosophical skepticism which rejects dogma and advocates the suspension of judgement over the truth of all beliefs. It was founded by Aenesidemus in the first century BCE, and said to have been inspired by the teachings of Pyrrho and Timon of Phlius in the fourth century BCE.[1] Pyrrhonism is best known today through the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, writing in the late second century or early third century CE.[2] The publication of Sextus' works in the Renaissance ignited a revival of interest in Skepticism and played a major role in Reformation thought and the development of early modern philosophy."

It is important, however, not to be dogmatic about Pyrrhonism either. "Everything in moderation, nothing in excess. Including moderation."
